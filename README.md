+ I did next to no research as to whether this kind of tool existed already and I'm glad I didn't - I learned a great deal from it and I recommend you all try it sometime.
+ I'm by no means a bash scripting expert - I literally cobbled this together from a few google searches and *a lot* of troubleshooting. If it helps you: great, if you think I'm an idiot and am totally doing something wrong: I'll happily take constructive criticism (especially in the form of pull requests - *hint hint*).

## What's it all about then?

What all started out as me wanting to do what all the "cool kids" were doing and getting a dotfiles repo going, ended up in me writing a script that will get me all set up on any new Linux/OSX system (of which the dotfiles is just a teeny tiny part).

I [wrote up a blog](http://remy.bach.me.uk/blog/2013/07/boost/) post about it with some more info.

##Â Usage

First, put any ssh keys you use in the `ssh` directory (they'll be ignored from the repo), then make a file in the `config` directory called `repos.cfg` and put each repo you'd want cloned on it's own line.

Once that's all done, simply `cd` into the directory and then type `./install.sh OS` replacing `OS` with one of: `Gnome`, `OSX`, or `Ubuntu`.
